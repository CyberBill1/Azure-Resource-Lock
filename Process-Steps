#The following steps are taken to activate a lock for a given Azure Resource:

Select Locks in the Settings blade for the resource, resource group, or
subscription that you want to lock.

Select Add to add a lock.

Select the parent if you want to create a lock at that level. 

The currently selected resource inherits the parent's lock. You could, for
example, lock the resource group to apply a lock to all of its resources.

Give the lock a name and select a Lock type (also known as lock level). You can
optionally include notes that describe the lock.

That is it, the resource is securely protected with respect to the type of lock
applied.
